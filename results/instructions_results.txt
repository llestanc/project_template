Contains everything obtained through manipulation or analyses of data contained in project_name/raw_data

# a file containing participants unique id in the project and the correspondance with other id in the project

# Formated data
	Should be the same structure as project_name/raw_data
	Make analysis-friendly data
	Use 
		- non-proprietary formats e.g. .cvs or normed format e.g. bids for mri/eeg
		- self-explaining variable names e.g. first_name
		- self-explaining cell content e.g. treated vs. untreated rather than 1 vs. 2
		- replace missing data by NA

	Make
		- each column a variable
		- each row a observation
		- a column containing a unique identifier for every record e.g. subject number used across different data tables
		- for imaging data name file after this unique identifier

	Name file with useful metadata e.g. date, group, centre â€¦

	Record all steps of data modification. Try making different scripts (functions) for each different step of data preprocessing and a meta script calling the functions.

# Preprocessed data
	If you want to do some cleaning (e.g. remove outliers)
	Name files with useful metadata (e.g. the standard deviation you used) or log of parameter used. 
	Record all steps of data modification. Try making different scripts (functions) for each different step of data preprocessing and a meta script calling the functions.

# Subsets of data
	if you want to work on parts of your dataset and avoid loading all data e.g. subgroups.
	Name files with useful metadata e.g. subgroup, time ...
