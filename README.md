# Project template

This is a downloadable template folder to manage your science projects and stay organised. 
It will allow yourself, collaborators and/or supervisors to retrieve stuff and save time. 

## Install

Click the green "Code" button on the top right of the page, and select "Download ZIP" in the drop down menu. 
Unzip the project_template-master.zip downloaded file where you want to set up your new project on your computer. 
Rename it with the name of your project and you're goog to go.

## Contributing

This template is here to evolve and suit the lab needs. 
Your can contribute to make it better by talking to me if you: 
- don't know where to place your stuff. You're probably not the only one and we need to make the template evolve. 
- don't understand the instruction. It will help me make them clearer for everyone.
- have suggestions.
