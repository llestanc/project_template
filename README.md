# Project template

This is a downloadable template folder to manage your science projects and stay organised.
It will allow yourself, collaborators and/or supervisors to retrieve stuff and save time.

## Install

- Click the "project_name.zip" file
- Click "Download"
- Unzip the project_name.zip downloaded file where you want to set up your new project on your computer.
- Rename it with the name of your project and you're good to go.

## Contributing

This template is here to evolve and suit the lab needs.
Your can contribute to make it better by talking to me if you:
- don't know where to place your stuff. You're probably not the only one and we need to make the template evolve.
- don't understand the instruction. It will help me make them clearer for everyone.
- have suggestions.
